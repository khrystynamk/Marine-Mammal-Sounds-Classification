# Marine Mammal Sounds Classification

This repository contains a project developed as part of a Signal Processing course, focused on the classification of marine mammal sounds. The primary goal of this work was to explore signal processing techniques for analyzing and identifying different marine mammal vocalizations, as well as to develop a deep learning model for automatic sound classification.

# ðŸ“Š Results

All results, including methodology, experiments, and analysis, are presented in the attached paper `MarineMammalSoundsClassification.pdf`. Please refer to it for detailed insights.

# ðŸš€ Future Improvements

- Data augmentation to increase dataset size, address class imbalance, and improve generalization.
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Exploration of advanced deep learning models for more accurate sound classification.
- Spectrogram-based classification â€” although this was the initial idea, it was not fully implemented due to time constraints. Future work could revisit this approach using image-based models (CNNs on spectrograms).
